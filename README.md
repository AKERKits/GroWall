*Source Files*

We model each kit in SolidWorks. To access the parametric source files, download the *AKER - Hexagon Planter - v1.0.zip* file and then establish local file references following this video: [AKER - Parametric Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewdrlv4nSA0). You can then adjust the model dimensions using the external *Equations.txt* file.
