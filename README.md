*Source Files*

We model each kit in SolidWorks. To access the parametric source files, download the *AKER - GroWall - v1.0.zip* file and then establish local file references following this video: [AKER - Parametric Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewdrlv4nSA0). You can then adjust the model dimensions using the external *Equations.txt* file.

The **GroWall** was modeled using our updated 2015 workflow. This source file pack has DXFs in the following formats:

 * 0.5 in Sheet Thickness / 0.25 in. or Smaller Bit Diameter
 * 0.75 in Sheet Thickness / 0.25 in. or Smaller Bit Diameter
 * 12 mm Sheet Thickness / 6 mm or Smaller Bit Diameter
 * 18 mm Sheet Thickness / 6 mm or Smaller Bit Diameter

*Nesting Layout*
